# fenixlib
.NET support for opening, creating and operating with [PixTudio](https://pixtudio.org), 
BennuGD(https://bennugd.org) and [DIV](http://div-arena.co.uk/) native graphic, 
graphic collections, fonts and palette formats.

A code is worth more than a thousand words... Here there is how to load a Fpg file:
    using FenixLib.IO;
    
    SpriteAsset asset = File.LoadFpg ( path );
    foreach ( Sprite sprite in asset )
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine ( sprite.Description );
    }
